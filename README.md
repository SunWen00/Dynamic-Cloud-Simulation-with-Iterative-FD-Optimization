# Dynamic-Cloud-Simulation-with-Iterative-FD-Optimization
Dynamic-Cloud-Simulation-with-Iterative-FD-Optimization is an open-source implementation of the fractal dimension (FD)-based iterative optimization algorithm for dynamic cloud simulation.

This algorithm is proposed in the paper "Complex Cloud-Sea Background Simulation for Space-Based Infrared Payload Digital Twin" (published in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, Vol. 18, 2025). DOI: 10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3523395.
